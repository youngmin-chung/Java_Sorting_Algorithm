### Sorting algorithm by Java

* Bubble sort - A bubble sort is one sorting technique. It can be applied to data structures such as an array. It works by comparing adjacent elements and exchanges their values if they are out of order. This method lets the smaller values "bubble" to the top of the list, while the alrger value sinks to the bottom.

* Heap sort - It's a comparison-based sorting technique. 
  * Step 1: Build a heap we need to transform it into a max heap
  * Step 2: In max heap, parent node is always greater than or equal to child nodes
  * Step 3: If it's not, swap it until it is. 
  * Stpe 4: Swap the first and the last node and delete the last node from the heap 
  * Step 2 ~ 4
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Quick sort
* Selection sort
